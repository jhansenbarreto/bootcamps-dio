        "description": "A Reptile Digimon with an appearance resembling a small dinosaur,it has grown and become able to walk on two legs. Its strength is weak as it is still in the process of growing, but it has a fearless and rather ferocious personality. Hard, sharp claws grow from both its hands and feet, and their power is displayed in battle. It also foreshadows an evolution into a great and powerful Digimon. Its Special Move is spitting a fiery breath from its mouth to attack the opponent (Baby Flame)."

        "description": "A hermit crab-like Digimon that lives in the margins of the 'Net Ocean'. Although it has a turtle-like appearance when its settled inside its shell, for all intents and purposes it has a soft body like a mollusk. Because its body rapidly gets bigger as it grows, it replaces its home each time until it reaches the size of a small mountain. Also, if its body can fit all the way in, it has a habit of settling in completely. Since it has low intelligence and a belligerent personality, you must be careful if you come across a Shellmon. Its Special Move is shooting liquid at high pressure (Hydro Pressure)."

        "description": "The original type of Insect Digimon who, although it has a hard shell, still has low aggression. It has one hard claw on each of its fore-legs, and four on each of its middle- and hind-legs, and in particular, the middle-legs are able to skillfully grasp objects just like a human hand. Although the other Insects at its evolution level only possess fighting spirit, it still retains its naturally friendly sentiments, and displays its carefree way of life by doing things like sniffing the scent of flowers and napping in the shade of a tree. Its Special Move, which it possesses just in case, is hurling static electricity that it amplified with its wings (Petit Thunder)."

        "description": "A Mammal Digimon characterized by its large ears. It is able to fly through the air by using them as large wings, but because it only goes at a speed of 1 km / h, it is said that it is definitely faster walking.However, it's very popular because its appearance is cute when it is desperately flying(though it seems that it doesn't feel the same). Due to its extremely obedient personality, its trainers are well- defended.Also, even though Patamon doesn't wear a Holy Ring, it is able to exhibit its hidden holy power, and it appears to have inherited the genes of ancient Digimon. Its Special Moves are sucking in air then spewing an air shot out in one burst(Air Shot), and striking the opponent with its large ears(Hane Binta)."

        "description": "A Mythical Dragon Digimon that, even with the vastness of the Digital World, is said to only exist on the Folder Continent. Its existence is extremely rare, and even on the Folder Continent, it is hardly encountered. Also, it is said that only one Digimon Tamer was able to tame V-dramon. With the exception of it becoming known as V-dramon due to the 'V'-shaped pattern on its chest, its way of life is a mystery, but for some reason, it is always mistaken for a dog. While its attack power is exceptional even among Adults, if put into a predicament, it exhibits power that surpasses even that of Perfects. Its Special Move is a high-temperature heat ray spewed out of its mouth (V Breath Arrow)."

        "description": "A British Punk Digimon that was born when Britain's strongest hacker caused a mutation in a computer virus in which they had poured all the knowledge they possessed. Although its size is small, it has a rebellious personality that contends for first place even in the Digital World. It can't help picking fights, no matter whether the opponents are stronger or weaker than itself. Although settling disputes with fist fights is considered its normal style, it has a Special Move 'Needle Squall' as its ultimate weapon, in which it launches its super-hard spines all at once from its metal head made from Chrome Digizoid."

        "description": "A Mythical Beast Digimon that grew gigantic wings. It's a highly valued monster due to it being said to have an existence close to that of a god. It specializes in mid-air attacks, its roar calls forth storms, and it causes giant tornadoes by flapping its wings. Its personality is considerably brutal, but it has great intelligence. However, being employed by an ordinary Tamer doesn't seem possible. Its Special Move is flapping its enormous wings to send out a sharp vacuum blade, (Spinning Needle)."
